# Phil Nash

Hi!

My name is Phil and I am a developer evangelist for Twilio and also the technical reviewer of the Practical Git book. I'm here testing the fork based workflow.

Come say hi to me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/philnash) or [check out my writing and projects on my site](https://philna.sh/).

Hope you're enjoying the book!

Phil
